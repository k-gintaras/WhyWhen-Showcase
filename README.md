# WhyWhen - Collaborative Story Game

![feature graphic](/images/image.png)

## Project Overview

WhyWhen is a unique multiplayer Android game that encourages users to collaboratively build stories through a question-and-answer mechanic. Users can create, share, and complete stories in real-time with friends. The app allows login-free gameplay, dynamic link sharing for easy invites, and an engaging question-based storytelling format.

> "Every game is a story built by many, reflecting each player's perspective."

## Key Features

- **Collaborative Story Creation:** Players answer questions that together form a cohesive story, encouraging teamwork and creativity
- **Dynamic Link Sharing:** Invite friends effortlessly with a shareable link
- **Real-Time Updates:** Game progress and story completion status are instantly shared among players
- **Ad-Supported Freemium Mode:** Enjoy free gameplay with ads, or upgrade to an ad-free experience with a premium option
- **Engaging Visual Elements:** Custom animations and intuitive design elements enhance user experience

## How WhyWhen Works

1. **Press > to Create a Game:** Start a new game session and generate a dynamic link
2. **Share the Link:** Invite friends via your favorite messaging platform
3. **Wait for Join Confirmation:** Once your friend joins, you can begin the collaborative story
4. **Answer Together:** Players take turns answering questions to create a story
